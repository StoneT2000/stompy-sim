# Stompy Robot by K-Scale Labs Description

Modifications made:
- Removed alpha channel from the color attributes to fix rendering of the robot in simulation (ray-tracing works fine regardless though)
- Disabled some inertial attributes that might be incorrect (at least simulator complains about it)
